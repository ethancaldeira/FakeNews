# FakeNews
A machine learning system in Python that uses Scikit-learn to detect fake news. Large amounts of labelled training set data is used with SQLite in order to train  the machine learning model which is the k nearest neighbor algorithm. The system has reached a 95% accuracy on news article validity predictions.
Article text data is parsed and pre-processed through a set of controlled vocabulary and passed data through a variation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in order to measure the frequent occurance of key words. The project is based in the command line but can be further expanded into a web application.
